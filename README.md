Tic Tac Toe is a simple game that provides the following options for player **_X_** and **_O_**:

- **_User .vs Computer_** - this is the default option where you, the user, play against the computer
- **_User .vs User_** - you play against yourself
- **_Computer .vs Computer_** - the computer plays against itself

You can also make the computer smart (unbeatable) by checking the "Incorporate AI" option.
